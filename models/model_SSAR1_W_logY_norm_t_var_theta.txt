# For this model, the natural log of raw counts were used as data (y). The state model
# is normal and the observation model is normal. 
#
# There is one slope and two two variances: one for nesting season and the other for non-nesting season. 
#
# I used quite informative prior for X[1] ~ dnorm(5, 0.1)T(0,) although variance of 10 should 
# be wide enough in the log scale.  I used similar priors for the slopes: dnorm(0, 0.1).
# For all standard deviations (process and observation), I used uniform between 0 and 20, 
# which should be wide enough in the log scale. 
#
# I didn't see any reason to make the priors flatter because that would make convergence difficult
# and did not gain anything in return.
